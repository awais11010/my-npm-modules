Description
"A friend loaned me this dog skull to scan, which is reproduced here by about 100 photos fed in to Agisoft PhotoScan. Being a part of nature, I dedicate it to the Public Domain. I hope to see some rad remixes! The zipped .dae file contains the raw mesh (fully textured!) exported by PhotoScan. Agisoft didn't capture the teeth properly, so I reconstructed them myself in the included STL, and removed scanner support material.

Update: Teeth have been reconstructed from photos using the digital sculpting tools in Blender. So now your prints can be extra fangy!"
